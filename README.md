To test any of the files, run `node filename.js` 

## NodeJS Challenges

1. Initialize a node project in this directory
2. Add scripts to run the `index.js` file and `bugHunt.js` file (2 script commands)
3. Add [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) and set up your scripts to get live updating with the nodemon command
