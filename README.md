# Array Method Challenge README

To test any of the files, run `node filename.js`

## Browser Based javascript

- run the code by:
  - copy/pasting it into the browser console
  - executing the javascript file with the browser
  - **added challenge**: creating an index.html file and rendering the content onto the page

## NodeJS Challenges

1. Initialize a node project in this directory
2. Add scripts to run the `index.js` file and `bugHunt.js` file (2 script commands)
3. Add [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) and set up your scripts to get live updating with the nodemon command

\_these commands will basically simplify the command needed to run the files
