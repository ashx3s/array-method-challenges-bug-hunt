// 1. print out the names of each character

// 2.  print out the names if the character's age is less than 40

// 3. wrap iterative logic in a function that can take any array and print out the name of the characters

// 4. wrap logic in a function that takes an array and an age to test with the conditional

// 5. add an if check to your code that will return an error message if the object doesn't have a "name" property

// 6. test your error handling by breaking one of the arrays and passing it into the function
